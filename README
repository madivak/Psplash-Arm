PSPLASH
=======

PSplash is a userspace graphical boot splash screen for mainly
embedded Linux devices supporting a 16bpp or 32bpp framebuffer. It has
few dependencies (just libc), supports basic images and text and handles
rotation. Its visual look is configurable by basic source changes.

Also included is a 'client' command utility for sending information to
psplash such as boot progress information.


Changelog
=========
Added fbinit.c and fbinit.h to enable psplash correctly access the FB in a standard linux way.
